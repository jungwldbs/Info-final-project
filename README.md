## Dataset Information
* For this project, we are using the marriage dataset created by the [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/marriage) on github.com. The dataset contains information such as divorce and marriage rate based on level of education, gender, income, region and ethnicity from 1960 to 2012.

## Purpose of this project
* This project is to help and answer questions that general population of the U.S. have about marriage. More specifically, one audience that could be especially interested is marriage counselors. Since marriage counselors make their entire business on helping failing marriages, having data about how different elements can affect marriage, can help them offer better help by having a deeper knowledge on the subject backed with information. Overall, while they may in particular be interested in the data, the general public who is interested in marriage in the future will be interested in learning the trends and patterns throughout the U.S.

### Interactive graphs are used to answer following questions :
+ Trends of marriage rate over time based on each gender and age
+ Trends of marriage rate over time based on each region
+ Trends of marriage rate over time based on each ethnicity and age
+ Possible cause of divorce over time based on education level received
+ Possible cause of divorce over time based on economic wealth
+ Trends of marriage rate based on age group over time
